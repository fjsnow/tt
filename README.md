## Tiny Todo

A tiny todolist app as a poc for a working Next.js v14 PWA
Navigate to [tt](tt.freddysnow.com) at-least once while connected to the internet, then you will be-able to load it anytime without internet in the future.

Your browser may also support "installing" it as an application.
This will give a true, very native feel as you could have it as an app, without having internet, and everything will work seamlessly. (I hope).
